## üß™ Testing Apple Pay

### Prerequisites for Testing
- **iOS Device**: iPhone/iPad with iOS 10+ and Touch ID/Face ID
- **Safari Browser**: Apple Pay only works in Safari on iOS
- **Apple ID**: Must have payment methods set up in Apple Wallet
- **HTTPS**: Your site must be served over HTTPS (required for Apple Pay)

### Test Steps
1. **Deploy your changes** to a staging environment with HTTPS
2. **Open Safari on iOS device** and navigate to your checkout page
3. **Select tickets** and fill in customer information
4. **Look for Apple Pay button** - it should appear above the card payment form
5. **Tap Apple Pay button** - should open Apple Pay sheet
6. **Complete payment** using Touch ID/Face ID
7. **Verify order creation** in your admin dashboard

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Apple Pay button appears on iOS Safari
- [ ] Apple Pay sheet opens when button is tapped
- [ ] Payment completes successfully
- [ ] Order is created in database
- [ ] Customer receives confirmation email
- [ ] Analytics tracking works correctly

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Apple Pay Button Not Showing
- **Check HTTPS**: Apple Pay requires HTTPS
- **Verify iOS Safari**: Only works in Safari on iOS devices
- **Check Apple Wallet**: User must have payment methods in Apple Wallet
- **Verify Stripe config**: Ensure Apple Pay is enabled in Stripe dashboard

### Payment Fails
- **Check certificates**: Ensure payment processing certificate is valid
- **Verify merchant ID**: Must match exactly in Apple Developer and Stripe
- **Check logs**: Look for errors in browser console and server logs
- **Test with different cards**: Some test cards may not work with Apple Pay

### Common Issues
1. **"Apple Pay is not available"**: Usually means HTTPS or Safari requirement not met
2. **Certificate errors**: Check that certificate is properly installed and uploaded to Stripe
3. **Merchant ID mismatch**: Ensure the same ID is used in Apple Developer and Stripe

## üì± Browser Support

### Supported Browsers
- **iOS Safari**: Full Apple Pay support
- **macOS Safari**: Apple Pay support (if Mac has Touch ID)
- **Other browsers**: Will show card payment form only

### Fallback Behavior
- If Apple Pay is not available, users see the standard card payment form
- No changes needed - the existing card payment flow remains intact

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### Before Going Live
1. **Switch to live Stripe keys** in your environment variables
2. **Create production merchant identifier** in Apple Developer account
3. **Generate production payment processing certificate**
4. **Update Stripe dashboard** with production certificate
5. **Test thoroughly** on production domain with HTTPS

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Production Stripe Keys
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_live_key_here
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_live_key_here
```
