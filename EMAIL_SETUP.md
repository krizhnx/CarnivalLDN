# Email Service Setup Guide

## Overview
This project now uses **Resend** as the email service provider instead of SendGrid. Resend is a modern, developer-friendly email API with excellent deliverability.

## Setup Steps

### 1. Sign up for Resend
- Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
- Create a free account (100 emails/day free tier)
- Verify your domain or use the provided sandbox domain for testing

### 2. Get Your API Key
- In your Resend dashboard, go to API Keys
- Create a new API key
- Copy the API key (starts with `re_`)

### 3. Environment Variables
Add the following to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Resend Email Service
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 4. Update Sender Email
In `src/lib/emailService.ts`, update the `from` field:

```typescript
from: 'Carnival LDN <tickets@yourdomain.com>', // Replace with your verified domain
```

**Note:** For testing, you can use the sandbox domain provided by Resend (e.g., `onboarding@resend.dev`)

### 5. Test the Setup
- Make a test ticket purchase
- Check your email inbox for the confirmation email with attached PDF tickets
- Check the server logs for email success/error messages

### Testing

To test the email service without making a purchase:

```typescript
// Add this to your server.js for testing
app.post('/api/test-email', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const testData = {
      customerName: 'Test User',
      customerEmail: 'your-email@example.com',
      orderId: 'test-order-123',
      eventName: 'Test Event',
      eventDate: '2024-12-25',
      eventLocation: 'Test Venue',
      tickets: [{
        tierName: 'General Admission',
        quantity: 2,
        unitPrice: 2500,
        totalPrice: 5000
      }],
      totalAmount: 5000,
      currency: 'gbp'
    };

    await sendTicketConfirmationEmail(testData);
    res.json({ success: true, message: 'Test email sent' });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});
```
